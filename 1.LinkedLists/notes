Why linked list would be better than an array.

1. If you want to insert an element at start. You need not shift all element by to different memory address.
    Ex: array [2,3,4,5]. If you want to add 7 to start of an array. You need to shift 2 , 3, 4, and 5 back. And make array like this [7,2,3,4,5].

    But if you want to add an element to start of linked list. You only need to remove that element and add something else in that memory address.

    2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 7 . Add 9 to start of list. 9 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 7.

2. Double Linked list.
    This will be useful for adding and deleting element at the last.
